% Communication with NI in Service Request #7414989       %
% NI confirmed bug in Corrective Action Request ID 482143 %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Hardware: PCIe-6321, PXIe-6341
% DAQmx version: 9.8.0f3
% System configuration: see attached MAX Report
% 
% Problem description:
% According to the specifications, the PCIe-632x and PXIe-634x support the following AO sample rates:
% 
% 1 channel: 900 kS/s
% 2 channels: 840 kS/s per channel
% 3 channels: 775 kS/s per channel
% 4 channels: 719 kS/s per channel
% 
% When configuring an AO task with multiple channels on one of these cards, the maximum sample rate of 917431.19 Hz is returned by the property SampClock.MaxRate, regardless of the number of channels within the task.
% 
% If then the sample rate of a task with multiple AO channels is set to the value of SampClock.MaxRate, it will abort with error -200018: 'DAC conversion attempted before data to be converted was available.'
% 
% Expected behavior: SampClock.MaxRate should return the maximum sample rate for the AO task that is actually achievable. (For AI tasks, this works already in DAQmx 9.8)
% Setting a sample clock that is too high should coerce the value to an achievable rate and/or return an error.
% 
% Steps to reproduce:
% Install a PCIe-632x or PXIe-634x. Open the attached VI.
% 1. Run it with one channel -> no error occurs
% 2. Configure 2 channels and start -> error -200018 occurs. Note that the maximum reported sample rate is incorrect (according to the specs)
% 3. Workaround: Set the Sample Clock Reduction Factor to 0.92 and run the task again -> the task should be executable now.
